# Cobol Truffle Documentation

**PRE-ALPHA**

**NOT EVERYTHING IN THIS DOCUMENTATION IS COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED AND MAY CHANGE**

*This documentation is currently under construction. It needs a lot of work...*

*Currently a lot of the implementation is copied from [SimpleLanguage](https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage).*

This implementation does not intend to be 100% compatible with the standard.
Instead it is implemented against cobol source that is used in production.
Because of this there may be assumptions that are not compatible!
Or: This aims to be an interpreter for opinionated cobol.

Currently a lot of Classes are in Parser, where they don't belong to.
This will requires some cleanup.
